# stuff to keep in mind

If the directory doesn’t exist → create it.
If it exists and is empty → reuse it.
If it exists and contains your .racer marker → safe to overwrite.
Otherwise → abort with a friendly message.

create a .racer file in each folder to mark if the folder is safe to edit

for index files keep 
 - schema version (to future proof backwards compatibility)
 - time generated at (to know when to override cache)
